        <h2>more about me</h2>
        <p>i build to solve real problems, ones that affect the <b>livelihood of millions.</b> from building a healthtech startup from 0 to 1, to scraping together my own side projects, i learn, code and improve all for the sake of making life better, meaningfully. <br/><br/>

my <b>bias towards action</b> helps bring these ambitions into fruition. i hop on interviews with families i serve, build and test prototypes, and seek feedback for each iteration. i can learn anything, from programming with tensorflow to designingvrR environments, but my empathy trumps all. i build for people, and i know what they need because i care about them.  <br/><br/>

i come from a low-income immigrant family, and <b>i know how hard life can get. </b> i build so another teen doesn't have to cower in fear at a pride parade. i build so another mother doesn't have to hide her mental struggle from her family. i build so another child doesn't have to watch their grandpa never recover from a stroke. <br/><br/>

i build with empathy and a <b>fierce passion for social good.</b></p>
